# windows-terminal-wsl-config
Stuff I configured while fiddling with WSL and windows terminal.

If you want to use this you will have to get a few stuff installed first :

* tmux
* fish
* neovim
* nodejs

Make fish your default shell :
`` chsh -s `which fish\` ``

With this the config should be working but there are a few optional thing you can do.

## terminal color

There's a folder that contains the color scheme I use for windows terminal along with a few other things.
You can use it for your own terminal. It should make for a more cohesive color palette.
